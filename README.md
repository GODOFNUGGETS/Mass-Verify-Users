For example you already have a server. 
A few members are verified and the rest you want to make them unverified apart from the users who already have the verified role. This code does it.
Make sure to add the ID of the verified and Unverified role and to add your discord bot token. 
When you run the code on like replit, do !verify and it should work
Make sure to add the Bot token and the role ID.
